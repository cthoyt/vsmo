comment: Comment: An instance of Site [snap:Site] is a mixture of independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities which act as surrounding environments for other independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities, most importantly for instances of object [snap:Object]. A site [snap:Site] is typically made of object [snap:Object] or fiat object part [snap:FiatObjectPart] entities and a surrounding medium in which is found an object [snap:Object] occupying the site [snap:Site]. Independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities may be associated with others (which, then, are site [snap:Site] entities) through a relation of "occupation". That relation is connected to, but distinct from, the relation of spatial location. Site [snap:Site] entities are not to be confused with spatial region [snap:SpatialRegion] entities. In BFO, site [snap:Site] allows for a so-called relational view of space which is different from the view corresponding to the class spatial region [snap:SpatialRegion] (see the comment on this class).

One example is the number of mosquito larvae collected per dip with a standard dipper.  Several indices have been developed for abundance of immatures of mosquito species that exploit water holding containers as larval development sites, such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  This includes the traditional Stegomyia indices and more recently developed pupal indices.  Stated reasons for using pupal indices include that (i) absolute counts of pupae are feasible in most domestic settings, (ii) larval indices do not account for variable mortality of the larval stage (based on crowding, variable food supply etc) which can impact container productivity, whereas pupal mortality is slight and less variable, and (iii) the number of pupae per person is highly positively correlated with the number of adult mosquitoes per person."

A variety of techniques have been developed to determine daily survival rate of insect vectors, especially mosquitoes." [VSMO:Authors]
comment: Estimation of the daily survival rate of the adult stage (typically female) of a mosquito vector. Various methods have been developed to estimate daily survival rate based on changes over time in the proportion of marked vectors or vectors of a certain physiological state, for example newly emerged green colored females, parous females or females at a certain stage in their gonotrophic cycle.\nNumerous methods have been developed to estimate daily survival rates of immatures, especially for species that develop in aquatic habitats such as artificial containers that readily can be monitored and where all immatures can be counted. This has resulted in development of detailed life tables for some species such as Aedes aegypti.

Insects commonly are multivoltine, with several generations in a single year.

For example, hard ticks lay eggs once in a single batch and then perish.  For arthropods with multiple reproductive cycles, the length of the cycles can vary with temperature and time needed to locate blood meal hosts or find sites to deposit eggs.

This is related to inactivity during times of the year with conditions that are unfavorable for host seeking, development , or reproduction.  In temperate climates, the seasonal activity period often coincides with the warm part of the year.  In subtropical and tropical climates, the seasonal activity period more commonly is related to rainfall patterns.  A single vector species with a broad geographical distribution that includes substantial climate variability may exhibit variation in the timing of peak seasonal activity in different part of its range.  In the case of ticks, different life stages of a given tick vector often have distinctly different seasonal activity periods.

name: CDC light trap
def: "Powered trap, developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and designated the CDC light trap, which combines a visual light attractant and short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods, and which can be enhanced with an olfactory attractant.  \n\nCOMMENT:\nThe original model was made from a 1-ft length of 3 1/4 inch internal diameter plexiglas tubing, slotted on each side to receive a metal bracket.  A 4.5-V d.c. motor was mounted on the bracket and a 2 5/8 inches two-bladed fan made from plastic or aluminum was fixed on its spindle.  A 4-V torch bulb was mounted directly above the motor at the top of the trap body. The motor and light-bulb drew 0.15 A each.   A detachable wire mesh screen was placed over the entrance of the trap body to exclude large insects.  A fine cloth mesh bag with a long narrow neck was fitted to the end of the trap body to receive the catch.  Finally, a large plastic or metal flat cover was placed above the trap to protect it from rain when used outdoors.\n\nThere have been many changes to the original design of the CDC trap, some of the most important involve substituting 1.5-V D-cell torch batteries, or 1.25-V nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, or more recently a 6-V gel-cell battery, for the original motorcycle battery.  Other changes include the employment of much more efficient miniature motors and 4- bladed or multi-bladed fans to ensure a better flow of air through the trap, incorporation of automatic timers to switch traps on and off, segregating mechanisms for sorting the catch into time-intervals, and frequently the use of less powerful lights, such as grain of wheat bulbs, although this is usually accompanied by supplementation with dry ice."

The entrance to the cylinder is usually covered with a mesh horizontal screen to exclude large insects.  Mosquitoes attracted to the light are drawn into the cylinder by an 8-inch diameter fan mounted near the top of the cylinder.

def: "Powered trap, designated the AMSS light trap, which combines a visual light attractant and short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods, and which can be enhanced with an olfactory attractant.  \n\nCOMMENT:\nThe AMSS (or SSAM) is essentially an improved CDC light-trap.  The 6-V d.c. motor is a Mabuchi RF510T, chosen because it gives optimum rev./min over a wide range of operating voltages.  The light-bulb is either a Chicago Miniature Lamp No.503 or 1490, chosen because they have a long life and relatively high light output.  The battery of choice is a gel-cell 6-V, 7.5-Amphr rechargeable sealed battery, which provides a relatively constant operating voltage for a long time.

About 1.45 kg of dry ice is placed in the tin after which a plastic snap-on polyethylene lid closes it.  Four to six holes punctured in the bottom of the tin allow carbon dioxide to flow downwards over the lower part of the trap, which consists of a vertical plastic plate having holders for two 1.5-V dry cell batteries that power a Mabuchi RE-260 motor (about 5000 rev./min) and a subminiature 1.5-V, 70 mA grain-of-wheat light-bulb.  The fan was originally a two-bladed plastic propeller that was boiled for a few minutes to soften the plastic, and while still hot the two blades were twisted to increase their pitch to about 45°, after which it was held under cold water so that it set to this configuration.  Later models, however, had a simple fan blade cut from sheet metal.  The blade is mounted upside down on the spindle of the motor, which is fixed inside a 7-cm long piece of 7.6-cm diameter plastic tubing.  A switch near the batteries on the vertical section of plastic allows the trap to be turned on and off." [ISBN:9781402066658]

To overcome these difficulties they designed a completely new trap made almost entirely of transparent plexiglas and consisting of three principal parts.  The trap head (A), in which there is a standard CDC light-trap motor and four-bladed plastic fan, is mounted under the rain cover (20.32-cm diameter).  A vertical 5-cm baffle (c) positioned below the fan and across the trap prevents vortexing and so reduces damage to the catch.  The middle holding cage (B) is made of a 20.32-cm length of 15.24-cm diameter plexiglas, and has a fine mesh screen (i) fitted at the top. The light-bulb (h) is maintained below the disc (bb) of the bottom part (C) of the trap.  This disc and central entrance chimney (I) are painted black to prevent light diffusing up through the trap. Insects attracted to the light source are sucked up by the fan through the small chimney into the trap body, where they are retained." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The main modifications were that the short plastic cylinder larger samples.  The main modifications were that the short plastic cylinder housing the motor and fan was increased in diameter from 7.6 to 10.8 cm.  The batteries were fixed to a cylindrical metal disc above the cylinder, and the mesh screen over the cylinder was omitted.  A 10.2-cm Thimboe-Drome propeller was mounted onto a Mabuchi RE-26 motor, but apparently any 1.5-3.0-V d.c. motor can be used.  As in some models of the EVS trap, the blades were twisted to a 45° pitch.  The light source was a sub-miniature 25-mA bulb.  A cloth collecting bag was fixed to the end of the plastic cylinder.  This part of the trap is, as in the EVS trap, suspended under a 1-gal capacity tin containing dry ice, which flows out through four 6.4-mm diameter holes drilled in its bottom.

def: "Powered trap, designated the updraft light trap, which combines a visual light attractant and short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nA disadvantage of conventional light-traps having a fan below the light is that despite the presence of a screen, large unwanted insects tend to drop down on the catch and cause damage.  To try to overcome this problem laboratory experiments were conducted with a trap having a horizontal 4-W black fluorescent light tube and a 6-V d.c. motor fitted with aluminum fan blades mounted above the light source.  Air was sucked upwards and expelled at right angles, through the collecting cage.  The ultraviolet light-trap of Wilton consists of a 4-W blacklight fluorescent tube (peak radiation about 3650 Å) operated from a 12-V car battery through an inverter and a 6-V d.c. motor with a 2-bladed fan connected through a 75 ohm resistor to the same battery.  A 1.2-cm square mesh screen is placed behind the lamp.  The collection cage consists of Tubeguaz stretched over two 10-in wooden embroidery hoops held apart by three 7-in long metal struts. The trap is constructed so that it can operate as a downdraft trap with the light above, or by inverting it as an updraft trap with the light below." [ISBN:9781402066658]

Light tubes giving either ultraviolet or white light with emissions of different spectral power distributions can be used.  These tubes consume only 0.5 A and have a life of about 5000 h.  They operate through a transistor ballast (inverter) from a 12-V d.c. battery.  The baffles housing the tube are slotted into a 19-cm length of clear acrylic 10-cm diameter tubing.  A removable wire mesh screen is held in position at the entrance of the trap body by a metal ring secured by three small clips.  A detachable metal cover rests on top of the baffles to protect it against rain.  Suction to draw mosquitoes into the trap is provided by either a 6-V motor connected to a resistor or by a 12-V motor.  A netting bag similar in shape to that used with the CDC trap, but differing in that the top and upper sections of its walls are made of cotton cloth not netting, is fitted to the trap body.  A slit like opening in the middle extends along a third of its circumference to allow damp cotton wool, or plastic foam sponge covered with filter paper, to be placed over the floor of the bag to help keep the catch alive overnight.  The edges of the slit opening are covered with Velcro.  A small transistorized photosensitized light cell, which permits the trap to be automatically switched on and off around sunset and sunrise, can be incorporated into the top of the metal box housing the ballast.  To prevent the catch escaping when the trap is automatically switched off, a smooth 11-cm diameter plastic funnel can be inserted into the base of the neck of the bag.  A small switch on the ballast box permits the operator to choose between manual or automatic operation." [ISBN:9781402066658]

name: counter-flow geometry trap
def: "Powered trap, designated the counter-flow geometry trap, which combines an olfactory attractant with short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe counter-flow geometry trap operates on the principle of producing two air streams flowing in opposite directions.  A downward flow produces a plume of carbon dioxide or other attractants from the bottom of the trap.  Mosquitoes are attracted to the CO2 odor plume and are caught in an updraft generated by a second fan.  The original trap was constructed from a clear PVC pretzel container, modified by removing the bottom and adding a mounting flange and a 10.16-cm diameter × 17.78-cm length of PVC thin-walled pipe. A 5.08 cm diameter × 30.48 cm length of PVC pipe was fitted inside the larger diameter pipe, extending 7.62 cm beyond each end of the 10.16-cm pipe.  An 80-mm fan was attached to the top of the PVC container.  A 40-mm fan was mounted so as to seal the 5.08-cm tube from the outer container and produce a downwards airflow which exits from the bottom of the 5.08 cm pipe.  A tube with an inner diameter of 0.32 cm passes through the outer container and into the side of the 5.08 cm pipe, above the 10.16 cm pipe, and provides an entrance port for CO2 to enrich the exit plume produced by the 40-mm fan.  A small lid was attached above the 80-mm fan to prevent rain damage to the fan and to the mosquito collection.  The CFG trap was hung from a pole so that the bottom of the attractant plume was approximately 50 cm above ground level." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Powered trap, designated the Haufe and Burgess trap, which combines a visual color attractant with short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nHaufe and Burgess considered that the failure to collect mosquitoes with light-traps in subarctic regions of Canada was due to the natural high light intensity of the nights and the absence of periods of total darkness in their working area.  For these reasons they designed traps that relied on a strong visual attraction.  A fan is mounted about midway in a vertical metal cylinder, which is painted with 12 spiral 1 5/8-in wide black and white stripes.  A horizontal disc considerably larger than the diameter of the cylinder is mounted above it to leave a small slit like entrance gap.  A circular opening slightly smaller than the diameter of the cylinder is cut from the middle of the disc to allow a free flow of air through the middle of the disc down into the cylinder and out at the base.  The disc is painted on both surfaces with 12 black and white stripes, which are expanded distally and taper towards the middle.  Both cylinder and disc are rotated by a fan belt from a small motor mounted near the base of the trap.  Mosquitoes attracted to the trap fly towards the black and white stripes on the cylinder, and their inwardly spiraling movement guides them to the top where they are prevented from overshooting by the disc.  They eventually fly through the gap between the disc and cylinder, and get sucked down into the trap and collected in a suitable net or killing bottle.  Alternatively, the catch can be collected in a removable magazine into which a number of small discs drop at pre-determined time intervals thus enabling the catch to be divided into hourly samples."

def: "Abundance estimate, designated the Lincoln / Petersen-Lincoln Index, which is based on mark-recapture data.\n\nCOMMENT:\nLincoln is usually credited with developing the method for estimating population size in which a known number of individuals are marked and returned to the parent population, prior to resampling, and hence the method is most frequently referred to as the Lincoln index.  The principle behind the method is that a known number of individuals are caught, marked and then returned to the population.  After a suitable interval to allow mixing a second population sample is taken and the numbers of marked and unmarked individuals recorded.  The ratio of the number of marked individuals in the second sample to the total number in the second sample (both marked and unmarked) will be the same as the ratio of marked individuals released from the original capture to the total population.  The simplest population estimates (P) are obtained from a single marking occasion and the use of the Lincoln Index to analyze the recaptures: P = an/r where P = the estimate of the number of individuals in the population, a = total number marked in the first sample, n = total number of individuals in the second sample, and r = total recaptures."

Essentially, the idea is that the population is sampled on three distinct occasions.  On the first occasion arthropods are caught, marked, and released, on the second occasion arthropods are caught and both unmarked and marked ones given another distinctive mark and released, and finally on the third occasion arthropods are caught and the number of types of mark recorded.   The intervals between marking must be sufficient for marked individuals to completely mix with the population, but not too long that a high proportion of marked individuals may die.  From an analysis of the numbers of marked and unmarked arthropods caught on the second and third occasions an estimate of the size of the population on the second sampling day can be obtained."

def: "Abundance estimate, designated Jackson's estimate, which is based on mark-recapture data.\n\nCOMMENT:\nJackson introduced two new deterministic concepts, the 'positive' and 'negative' methods. \n\nPositive method.  In the positive method the loss ratio is calculated for a specific release day across all release groups.  A large number of individuals are caught and marked on a single occasion and are subsequently recaptured on a series of occasions.  Marked individuals are recorded at each recapture and all, or most of them are then released to avoid reducing the numbers of marked individuals available for future recapture.  This gives information on the changes in the proportions of marked to unmarked individuals on each sampling occasion.  Extrapolation of mark-recapture data gives an estimate of the number of recaptures that would have been obtained if sampling had occurred directly after marking, assuming of course that marked individuals had mixed with the unmarked population.\n\nNegative method.  Marked and unmarked individuals should theoretically have a common loss rate, due to mortality or emigration.  Any difference between the proportional recovery of marked individuals from two successive releases on different dates on a subsequent recapture occasion, should indicate the degree of change that occurred in the first marked group of individuals during the period between the two markings and releases.  Working on this principle Jackson devised his 'negative' method, which estimates the loss ratio from the subsequent daily percentage losses for two release groups. In this method a series of catches are made in which individuals are marked and released, but only on the last catch are the recaptures of marked individuals and the number of marks on them recorded.  An advantage of this method is that careful classification of individuals according to marks is only required on the final sampling occasion." [ISBN:9781402066658]

In Method B the recaptures are grouped according to the date on which they were last marked and all other marks are ignored.

The basic assumptions are that: (i) on any sampling occasion all vectors in the population have the same probability of capture and all those caught have the same probability of being released again, irrespective of the previous capture history of the vector; (ii) the survival rate between day i and day i + 1 is the same for all individuals in the population, independent of age; and (iii) emigration is permanent and thus is equivalent to death."

His trap consists of a 19 1/2 inch high aluminum cone, having a basal diameter of 14 inches and an apical 5 inch opening, covered with colored saran mesh supported on four 18 inch long struts.  A petri dish is tightly secured by a sprung cord over the top opening of the trap, which is provided with a rubber or plastic foam collar to ensure a tight fit.  Insects in the trap are viewed from above through the glass petri dish and are collected by inserting the long, curved, pliable copper collecting piece of a specifically designed aspirator through a slit in a double-rubber seal fixed into the netting of the trap.  The trap is maintained with its bottom rim about 3 cm below the water surface by seating the trap on adjustable sliding brackets fixed to three rod-like legs.  As the water level fluctuates trap height is adjusted, but when the water depth falls to about 5 cm the trap can be moved to a deeper part of the habitat;  (2) Pritchard and Scholefield  developed another cone trap in which the cone itself acts as the collecting vessel.  A 1-m pointed metal stake is passed through the center of a 25 cm diameter aluminum alloy rim, the position of which on the stake can be adjusted by a clamp screw." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Equipment for collection of aquatic arthropod immatures, in the form of a concentrator device to concentrate the catch from multiple water samples.\n\nCOMMENT:\nImmatures collected from a number of dips are frequently pooled, and various simple devices have been designed to strain the larvae from the water of the samples to concentrate the catch.  An obvious disadvantage of any method that combines catches from several samples is that the variances cannot be calculated.  To overcome this and to reduce the time needed to remove the catch from dippers, Earle constructed an automatic device for collecting aquatic specimens, termed ADCAS. A 6 inch diameter metal funnel is soldered into the top of a 7 inch high metal cylinder.  The 1 inch diameter opening at the opposite end of the funnel is soldered to a metal screw cap of a bottle of about 120 ml capacity.  Two rectangular 1 x 2 1/4 in openings are cut from the sides of the funnel and covered with 96 mesh screen. A 7/16 in hole is drilled into the side of the funnel and a copper inverted U-tube acting as a siphon is inserted, with one end placed inside the collecting bottle.  A removable cylinder of 96 mesh screen 9/16 inches diameter is soldered onto a bronze collar, which is screwed on to the threaded end of the copper siphon.  Four bronze wire vertical guards are soldered around the outside of the cylinder to help protect it from damage.  A removable 6 1/2 in diameter sieve made from about 8 mesh gauze is also constructed.  Successive samples collected by a dipper are poured through the funnel and when the collecting bottle fills up the siphon automatically lowers the water in the bottle to the level of its intake.  The coarse circular sieve can be placed over the top of the funnel to exclude stones and debris.\n\nOthers have produced simpler concentrators, for example the concentrator of Warren and Eddleman which basically consists of a 1 gallon white plastic bottle with one end removed and replaced with a 1/8 mesh sieve.  Another example is Hagstrum who used the very simple procedure of pouring the contents from 10 dips through a muslin cloth, which was then tied up and placed in 5% formaldehyde." [ISBN:9781402066658]

A weighted rubber stopper is secured to a length of nylon string attached to a plastic rod, which is placed across the opening at the opposite end of the cylinder.  In use, after the larger cylinder has been firmly thrust into the bottom of a pool, the smaller cylinder is inserted and carefully pushed down to the bottom.  After a predetermined time to allow mosquito larvae enclosed by the cylinders to pass through the smaller opening of the cone, the stopper is pulled up to seal the inner cylinder.  This is then withdrawn and trapped larvae emptied into a dish and sorted." [ISBN:9781402066658]

There is a similar length of plexiglas 10.5 cm in diameter with the bottom closed with two discs of plexiglas in between which is sandwiched a rubber ring that forms a seal with the outer cylinder.  A 3.6 cm diameter hole is made in this \"rubber sandwich\" which is bevelled on the lower side to facilitate water flowing into the cylinder, and bevelled into the middle on the interior rim to facilitate seating of a rubber stopper mounted at the end of a steel rod.  To operate, the outer cylinder is thrust into the bottom substrate and then the inner cylinder is pushed down so that the water enters through the bottom hole.  The rubber stopper is then pushed into the hole and the sample poured through a 10 cm funnel mounted over a screen cylinder (6 cm x 2.5 cm)." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The probe is a 30 inch length of 0.5 inch diameter electrical conduit with four 3/4 inch holes drilled perpendicular to each other near the end.  This end section of the conduit is enclosed in a 2 inch diameter 10 inch long sleeve of 18 gauge stainless steel perforated with numerous 5/16 inch holes acting as a coarse filter.  The end of the conduit is closed with a bolt-on conical cap.  A length of garden hose connects the upper part of the conduit to a 12-V self-priming pump operated from a 12-V car battery.  About 4.24 gallons of water are sucked up per minute. Water is pumped up into an inverted 8 inch diameter metal funnel having a 350 mesh nylon sieve attached to the bottom.  The narrow end of the funnel is placed in a 1-quart jar, and material deposited on the sieve flushed through the jar." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Single cylinder area sampler with internal cone for collection of aquatic arthropod immatures designed by Bidlingmayer.\n\nCOMMENT:\nBidlingmayer's larval trap consists of two parts.  One part is a galvanized cylinder fitted with pair of handles.  The other part is inserted in the cylinder.  The simplest is a metal cone with a apical opening and a basal so that it is a sliding fit within the cylinder.  A metal cylinder is placed over the cone and riveted in position.  The alternative insert for the trap consists of a cylinder with floor about 4 inches from the base and composes of a series of small pyramids (14 complete' partially complete pyramids) with a base of 3.5 inch square. Each small pyramid has an apical opening.  The outer cylinder is thrust into the mud and enclosed plants pulled up and vigorously shaken in the water within the cylinder.  All pieces of plant, either rooted or free floating, are removed.  After 5-10 min, either type of insert is pushed down into the cylinder until its opening is about 1-2 inches below the water surface.  Larvae surface and pass through the single cone, or pyramids, and are trapped in the space above the opening surrounding the insert.  The trap can be left in position for 24 h, or removed sooner so long as sufficient time has been allowed for the larvae to surface.  Larvae are recovered from the trap by baling or siphoning out the water surrounding the cone, or pyramids.  The water can be emptied into a white dish and the larvae collected.  A more rapid larval recovery might be obtained if the contents were sieved and floated in saturated magnesium sulphate." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "A soil sample egg extractor in the form of a soil washing machine designed by Horsfall.\n\nCOMMENT:\nHorsfall described a method of wet sieving to remove eggs of floodwater mosquitoes from soil samples.  Samples are removed from oviposition sites by a cutting square.  This consists of a sharpened metal band bent into a 6 inch square fixed to a wooden square with a handle on top.  It is pushed into the ground to a depth of about 1 inch and the sample cut from the soil below with a spade after which it is placed in a bag and taken to the laboratory.  The sod of soil is then placed in the inner of three concentric cylindrical metal screens, having 4, 8 and 18 meshes per inch respectively.  The lower halves of these cylinders are immersed in a water bath.  A central shaft runs through the middle of the inner cylinder and when its handle is turned the three cylindrical sieves rotate and pass through the water bath.  This treatment breaks up the soil sample in the sieves and flushes the eggs, and other comparatively small particles, through into the water bath.  A bottom tap on the water bath is then opened and the contents empty into the first of three metal sieves (40, 60 and 100 mesh/inch) placed one above the other.  A strong jet of water washes the eggs through the top two sieves onto the screen of the bottom sieve, from which they are washed on to a small cylindrical fine mesh transfer screen.  Further separation from soil particles is achieved by flotation." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Powered, backpack-carried aspirator (suction sweeper) to collect arthropods designed by Meyer.\n\nCOMMENT:\nMeyer found the aspirators of Davis-Gould and Nasci unsuitable, mainly because of their size and/or lack of power, and designed a lightweight more powerful machine termed the AFS (Arbovirus Field Station) sweeper.  Basically it consists of a lightweight L-shaped metal backpack adapted to hold a plywood platform (8 x 13 inches) supporting two 6 V rechargeable gel cell batteries.  These are connected in series to deliver 12 V at a minimum of 16 A, which is needed to operate the blower for about 1 h.  The blower is a 12 V Dayton model (2C646) and is mounted underneath the plywood platform on the horizontal section of the backpack.  Air displacement of the blower is about 2.12 cubic meters per minute, which represents improved suction over most previous battery operated aspirators.  The suction tube is composed of various sections of 4 inch diameter black PVC piping (as used by plumbers and called ABS tubing), and about 4 feet of 4 inch diameter automobile defroster hose, making altogether a tube about 8 feet long.  Mosquitoes are sucked into a 1 pint sized paper carton having a nylon-screened bottom which is inserted where the handle section and nozzle join.  This collection carton can be rapidly removed, its lid placed on and a new carton inserted.  A screen of netting is inserted over the collecting tube to prevent leaves and twigs being sucked into the collection carton." [ISBN:9781402066658]

A D-vac collecting bag is folded over the other end of the plastic tube and held in position by S-shaped clips attached to large rubber bands.  Two metal gate handles are fixed on the metal cylinder.  Wire from the motor passes to a push button switch on the metal tube and then to two 6 V gel batteries connected in series, which will power the aspirator for at least 6 hr." [ISBN:9781402066658]

A 3-inch diameter two-blade aluminium propeller is fixed to a motor housed in a 3 1/2 inch outside diameter 4 inch length of clear cast acrylic tubing.  The basal 3/8 inch of a 1 inch wide, 3 1/2 inch inner diameter ring of acrylic plastic is cemented over the opposite end of the fan housing.  A pint-sized cardboard carton, 3 3/8 inches in outer diameter, with the bottom end removed and covered with no. 24 nylon mesh, is seated within the in projecting 5/8 inch rim of this plastic ring.  This comprises the removable collection chamber.  A collecting tube made from acrylic tubing of the same shape and size as the fan housing is fitted to the top of the cardboard carton by a similar 1 inch wide 3 1/2 inch inside diameter ring of plastic.  A 15-inch length of 1inch aluminium angle is fitted along the outside of the complete collecting unit, being permanently fastened to the fan housing by a circular metal ring and to the collecting tube by elastic bands.  The 3 inch length of angle that extends from the back of the fan housing is riveted to a 24 inch long handle of 1inch diameter aluminium tubing.  After mosquitoes have been collected the motor is kept running while the front tube is removed and a lid is placed on the cardboard carton, which is then removed and replaced with another. \n\nThe original aim was to collect mosquitoes resting amongst vegetation by slowly moving the apparatus backwards and forwards in a sweeping motion, hence its name.  The motor, however, provides insufficient suction for this and the machine is more usually used as a powered aspirator for collecting mosquitoes resting in shelters and traps." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Powered aspirator to collect arthropods designed by Perdew and Meek. \n\nCOMMENT:\nPerdew and Meek argued that their aspirator, made by modifying a commercial cordless broom blower, provides greater suction and requires less modification than many previous battery powered aspirators.  The basic equipment is a blower-type broom that consists of a plastic body incorporating a fan and a motor, and in its handle rechargeable cadmium batteries, and an extension tube tapered and curved distally.  To convert the broom into an aspirator the wires to the motor are reversed and the tapered end of the extension tube cut off.  Two rigid plastic tapered beakers (474 ml) having a minimum 9 cm inner diameter at the top are required.  To make an elongated version of the aspirator a selected length of the bottom of the plastic cup is cut off to leave a 6.9 cm opening that can be glued to the inside of the extension tube.  A 473-ml paper cup has a 6.4 cm diameter hole cut from both its lid and its bottom, and both holes covered with screening of suitably sized mesh.  This forms the collection carton, and without its lid, is pushed tightly into the plastic cup stuck in the end of the extension tube.  This extended version of the aspirator is 118 cm long.  A shorter (65 cm) version can be made by cutting the bottom from a similar plastic cup to leave a 7.4 cm diameter opening.  After two opposing rectangles are cut out the cup is fitted over the end of the main body of the cordless broom and secured with four screws.  The paper cup (collection carton) is fitted into the end of the plastic cup, the extension tube is not used.  After using either the extended or short aspirator the screened lid is pushed on the paper cup, which is then removed and replaced with another.  The aspirator can operate efficiently for about 45 min, with a minimum air flow of 21 cubic meters per minute." [ISBN:9781402066658]

name: pipe trap shelter
def: "Pipe-shaped shelter for resting adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nNelson developed an artificial rodent burrow termed the pipe trap for collecting resting mosquito vectors.  The device consists of three parts, a pipe, a plunger and a collecting carton.  The pipe consists of a 91 cm length of 18.5 cm outside diameter asbestos-cement sewer pipe, both ends of which taper to 16.2 cm in diameter.  The pipe absorbs moisture.  The plunger is a 91 cm length of 4.76 mm steel rod having a 14 cm wooden disc fixed at the end, to which is glued a piece of 16.5 cm diameter foam rubber.  The collecting component consists of a 16.5 cm  long, 3.8 litre cardboard carton.  The bottom is removed and a 30.5 cm length of tubular stockinette is taped over the outside of the carton.  The other end (top) is removed or modified so that the sleeve section of a CDC collecting bag is fitted over the end.  Alternatively a sleeve of stockinette or mosquito netting is fixed over the top end of the carton.  A hole is dug in the ground and the pipe inserted at an angle of 20-25 degrees from the horizontal so that about 7.5 cm projects from the hole.  The piston-like plunger is pushed down to the bottom of the pipe.  The following day any mosquitoes that have rested in the pipe are removed, by firstly fitting the stockinette sleeve on the bottom of the carton over the end of the pipe.  The collector then reaches through the top sleeve and slowly pulls up the plunger, while squeezing the top sleeve to prevent mosquitoes escaping.  When the foam rubber disc is flush with the end of the pipe the stockinette tube is eased off the pipe and pinched off across the face of the disc.  The carton is then slipped off from the rod and both ends tied.  The trap is then reset by pushing the plunger down to the bottom of the pipe." [ISBN:9781402066658]

One side is inverted to form an entrance funnel narrowing to about a 1/4 inch diameter opening.  The funnel was supported within the cage by string tied from its narrow end to the four corners of the trap.  One or two small cloth sleeves incorporated in the sides of the cage enabled aspirators to be inserted to remove the catch.  The trap is usually placed in the middle of a piece of black cloth which is secured over a window.  A large proportion of the vectors which seek to leave the building at dawn are attracted by light entering the window, and are consequently caught in window traps as they try to escape."

A piece of mosquito netting is taped either directly over one end, or over a short piece of smaller diameter tubing, which is inserted into the end of the larger tubing.  A 50 cm length of rubber or pliable plastic tubing is slipped over the end of the glass tubing, and a small section of plastic or glass tubing is inserted into the opposite end to form a mouth piece.  Several mosquitoes can be sucked up into the aspirator before they are gently blown into a suitable storage container. \n\nAspirators with reservoirs can be used to reduce the likelihood of mosquitoes escaping and to enable larger numbers to be collected before the aspirators need emptying.  In these aspirators the collecting tube has to be removed before the adults can be extracted." [Add:Silver, ISBN:9781402066658]

Consequently, an exit cage without any kind of one-way entrance was used.  At short intervals a partition was slid across the window cage to enclose the catch and enable the cage to be removed and another inserted.  It was thought that if the cage was frequently changed very few mosquitoes would escape by flying back into the hut.  Although such an exit trap providing unimpeded entry may catch more mosquitoes than one with a restrictive entrance, the necessity of regularly replacing the cages and removing the catch involves considerable manpower."

To try to overcome these difficulties Shidrawi described a collapsible window trap.  This consists of two lengths of 3 mm thick wire rods bent and soldered to form two rectangular frames (55 x 40 cm).  These are joined together at the corners by four lengths (Nos. 1-4) of 40 cm wire which are fixed into bushes welded or screwed on to the rectangular frames.  Four similar rods (Nos. 5-8) are fixed between the framework 15 cm from the top to divide the trap into a small upper (40 x 15 cm) and a large lower (40 x 40 cm) section.  The floor of the upper section is divided about 24 cm from its front by two horizontal rods having about a 2 cm gap between them.  A mosquito netting and cloth cage made to fit the shape of the trap is suspended within the frame-work by tapes.  A ramp of mosquito netting is made to stretch from the bottom edge of the cage to the posterior wire rod.  A rectangular piece of dark cloth covers the floor of the upper section from the front to the first rod.  Mosquitoes entering the lower half of the trap are guided up the ramp through the narrow slit between the two rods into the upper section and lower section behind the ramp.  Triangular pieces of dark cloth are used for the sides of the entrance." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Trap made from netting, designed by Fletcher, in which a horse is used as bait to attract host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nFletcher preferred to collect biting insects from a horse-baited trap, which used the same principles as the one designed by McCreadie.  Namely, the bait (horse) is restricted in a wooden stanchion surrounded by a wooden frame (4 x 10 ft and 7.5 ft high).  The upper and lower parts of the frame are covered with 40 mesh plastic screening, except that the upper 30 cm is covered with clear polythene sheeting and contains on each long side three collecting holes (6 x 8 inches) with lengths of stockinette.  The edges of the two long sides of the trap (left and right) are sealed with plastic foam weather stripping and when erected over the horse are held in position by elastic straps.  Each side of the trap is hinged to a base frame of wooden boards (2 x 8 inches and 6 ft long) thus allowing the two sides to be opened to expose the horse and when required raised and closed.  The roof slopes down towards the middle to form a V-shape, this causes the entrapped mosquitoes to gather along the upper edges of the trap and facilitates their removal, when aspirators are inserted through the entrance ports.  For ease of construction the trap is made in sections.  The upper part is divided into two sections while the lower part comprises four L-shaped sections.  The horse is exposed to biting flies for about 15 min and is then enclosed within the trap, and after allowing 30 min for entrapped vectors to feed they are collected.  Although most biting flies fly to the top of the trap and are readily collected, blood-engorged mosquitoes tend to rest on the sides so additional collection holes should be made along the middle of the trap and at the two ends."

When animals such as donkeys and calves are used there is no need for a floor, but unless animals such as pigs and rodents are enclosed within a cage, a floor may be necessary to prevent them from burrowing and escaping.  A door is fitted at one end of the trap, and another may be fitted at the opposite end so that larger animals can be removed without turning them round.  Apart from the roof as much as possible of the trap should be made of plastic or wire mesh mosquito gauze to allow bait odors to escape, but the lower half usually has to be made of stout plywood or sheet metal on a wooden frame, to prevent the animals from kicking it to pieces.  Mosquitoes enter the trap through a horizontal entrance slit placed about halfway up the trap.  This entrance slit may extend completely round the trap, or be confined to the two longer sides.  The construction of the slit is the most critical part in building the trap.  It is usually made from 4 inch wooden planks placed to form a V-shaped trough with a 6-8 inches wide opening to the outside converging to leave a 3/4 to 1 inch slit-like opening in the trap.  The walls of the trap above the entrance baffle are made of mosquito gauze and those below of wood.  It is often convenient to make the trap demountable with the various sections fixed into position with bolts and wing nuts, enabling it to be readily transported to different sites.  Strips of plastic foam stuck along the edges of the different sections eliminate gaps through which the vectors might escape." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Trap in the form of a stable, designed by Roberts, in which a large animal is used as bait to attract host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nRoberts designed a modified Magoon-type trap which had better air circulation thus enabling bait odors to disseminate more efficiently from the trap.  Another feature of the trap was that mosquitoes could enter it at several heights.  The trap consists of a wooden framework, 7 ft long, 5 ft wide, 6 ft high, with a flat roof and a door at one end.  The bait animal is confined in a stanchion to keep it in the center and prevent it from damaging the trap.  About the top 1 ft of all sides and door are covered with polythene sheeting, while the rest of the door and sections in between the baffles are covered with fine copper wire mesh screen.  The Magoon-type horizontal baffles are built into the two long sides of the trap at ground level and at heights of 2 and 4.5 ft.  There are no baffle entrances in the end sections."

A thatched sloping roof reached to the ground on both long sides, and both ends were also covered with thatch.  A doorway (2.5 x 1.5 ft) was left at one end for the entry of vectors and a bamboo gate was fixed across this entrance to prevent predators from entering.  Two strips of dark cloth were suspended from the roof to provide additional resting places for mosquitoes, which were collected by aspirators after a canvas curtain had been pulled across the doorway.  Hut dimensions were 3 m x 3 m x 3 m and were constructed from coconut thatch.  A gap of 6cm was left at the bottom of the walls to allow mosquitoes to enter." [ISBN:9781402066658]

It consists of two parts, a wooden stable and a dawn trap.  The stable has specially constructed light proof overhanging eaves which leave a 6 inch gap on three sides of the stable, through which mosquitoes can enter to feed on the bait animal.  A close fitting door is provided to the stable which is dark inside, and may be painted black.  The wooden dawn trap which measures about 3.5 x 3.5 ft and 5 ft high is painted white inside except for the rear wall which is made of mosquito screening. It is fitted to the wall of the stable that faces the rising sun.  Mosquitoes that have entered the stable at night to feed on the bait are attracted to the light coming from the dawn trap.  They consequently fly though the 30 inch wide opening of a screen mesh baffle fitted into the rear wall of the stable and pass through a 1 1/2 inch wide longitudinal slit into the dawn trap."

To overcome this Wilton modified two commercially available portable summer screen rooms normally used to provide insect-proof living facilities out of doors.  The smaller screen room measured 3.6 x 3.6 x 2.2 m and weighed about 14 kg, the larger room was 3.0 x 4.2 x 2.3 m and weighed some 15.8 kg . All four sides were made of mesh screen and were supported by tubular metal frames, the rooms had a nylon zipper entrance.  To convert them to vector traps two 41 cm vertical slits were cut at the bottom of all four corners to enable the sides to be raised 20 30 cm above the ground and secured by spring clips for entry of vectors."

def: "Trap made from netting, in which a small animal is used as bait to attract host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nNet traps have been widely used to collect vectors attracted to a variety of small animals including chickens, rabbits and monkeys.  The simplest arrangement consists of positioning an ordinary single or double-sized mosquito net over a host and raising it a few cm from the ground to allow entry of host-seeking vectors.  The animal typically is contained in a cage so as to not disturb the net.  As one example, Wharton used net traps baited with monkeys to collect mosquito vectors.  The monkeys were kept in a small cage covered with chicken wire, which did not prevent the mosquitoes from feeding on them.  Small nets measuring 4 x 3 x 3 ft, having a 14 inch wide 3 ft high opening on either side held two monkeys and larger nets measuring 6 x 5 x 4 ft with two 22 inch wide and 4 ft high openings were used to hold four monkeys.  The traps were positioned either at ground level or at various heights in trees, and mosquitoes collected from them every 1-2 h throughout the night." [VSMO:Authors]

To get more representative collections, de Freitas devised a trap in which vectors attracted to sentinel mice were automatically trapped at intervals.  Mice are exposed in a 10 x 10 x 12 cm cage of wire mesh suspended from an aluminum hood, 62 cm square and 32 cm high.  A 26 cm tall, 21 cm square, chimney having the lower half made of nylon netting and the upper half of aluminum is placed underneath the hood and surrounds the bait cage.  A 19 cm fan blade is fixed to the spindle of a 6 V motor enclosed in a plastic bag and placed under the center of the bait cage.  It operates from a 6 V car or gel cell battery.  The updraft of air produced opens a pair of 11.5 cm square plastic foam trap doors fitted to the top of the aluminum hood, and which fall shut when the fan is not operating.  Originally the minute hand of a clock, which was housed in a small box underneath an aluminum roof, was wired to the positive lead from the car battery to the fan motor, so that electrical contact was made for a period of 90 s every 15 min.  During the short exposure period mosquitoes attracted to the sentinel mice are blown up through the open doors into a 23 cm square, 30 cm high, plastic mesh collecting cage placed on top of the hood.  The complete trap is suspended by wires under a large flat protective aluminum roof." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The collecting cage is made from nylon or terylene netting and is 20 inches long and 12 inches in diameter except that at both ends a curtain wire threaded through a 1/2 inch hem reduces the diameter to about 10 inches.  A 12 inch circular piece of 1/4 inch plywood with a wire loop handle is inserted in the top of the cage as a convenient lid.  A short length of plastic tubing, such as a vial with the bottom removed, is cemented into the middle of the cage so that an aspirator can be inserted for removal of the catch.  An 8 inch long, 6 inch diameter metal tube (e.g. a 5 lb dried milk tin with both ends removed) is mounted in a 12 inch disc of plywood placed in the bottom of the trap.  A 6 V motor is held by aluminum brackets or straps midway inside the tube.\n\nA 2- or 3-bladed 6 inch diameter plastic propeller with a 4 inch pitch, such as used in model aircraft, is fixed to the spindle of the motor.  The top of the metal tube is closed by a circular flap of 1/4 inch polystyrene foam, cemented only at one point, so that when the motor operates, the updraft of air forces the flap open.  It falls back into place when the motor stops.  A bait cage about 3 inches in diameter and length made from 1/2 inch galvanized wire mesh is supported at the bottom of the fan housing by two long meat skewers running through it at right angles.  Wiring the motor to a 6 V motorcycle or gel cell battery through a clock allows the fan to automatically operate for 30-45 s every 7-10 min.\n\nDavies pointed out that trap dimensions are not critical, in fact modified trap cages can be made for baiting with other animals than mice such as rats, wild rodents, birds or bats."

The frame of this double-baited trap is made from 1/2 inch galvanized or stainless steel wire.  The various sections can be soldered or tied together, or with some ingenuity the entire framework of the trap can be made by bending a single length of wire into the appropriate shape.  Each end section of the trap is formed by bending the wire to form a W and then the outer limbs of the W are connected overhead by two semicircular pieces or wire.  The two end sections are linked by two 16 inch horizontal lengths of wire running from the outer top ends of the W-shaped wire frame, and by two similar strips separated by a 1 inch gap connecting the central apex of the two W-shaped frames.  This gap forms the entrance for the vectors.  The framework of the lower part of the trap is covered with wire mesh while the upper part supported by the two semi-circles of wire is covered with white nylon mosquito netting which is sewn on to the framework except at the front end.  A touch and close fastener such as Velcro is sewn on to the wire mesh at the front end of the trap and also along the bottom edge of the mosquito netting cover.  Alternatively the top cover can be made as a bag that is dropped over the cage and held in position by a large strip of rubber such as cut from an old motor car inner tube.  The trap is normally baited with small vertebrates contained in a small mesh cage supported on wire supports in each section of the trap, but the trap has also been successful when baited with dry ice contained in plastic bags or polystyrene boxes.  The trap is normally suspended from a tree and protected from rain by a horizontal sheet (18 x 24 inches) of metal.  Vectors enter from below through the long vertical centrally placed slit.  They are collected by inserting an aspirator underneath the bottom edge of the mosquito netting cage covering the trap.  The trap has been used with various bait animals including chickens, wild birds, various rodents and lizards." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The upper surface can be painted, usually black, to protect the wood, while the lower surface is painted white.  The net cage is made from a piece of 38 x 18 inches terylene netting with a 1/2 inch hem along both longer edges, by sewing the two shorter sides together to form a tube.  A 28 inch length of flexible curtain wire is threaded through the top hem and a 9 inch length of 1/4 inch wide elastic through the bottom hem.  A short section of a 1 in diameter plastic tube having a removable top or cork is cemented into a slit made in the side of the bag.  This provides a simple but efficient opening for inserting an aspirator.  Alternatively a slit-like opening furnished with a touch and close fastening such as Velcro could be used.  The bait cage is made from a 1 US quart motor oil tin cut in half and with both ends removed to give a 4 inch diameter, 2 3/4 inch long cylinder.  Half-inch galvanized wire mesh screening rolled round to form a 4 inch diameter, 13 inch long cylinder is slipped down over the bait tin for about 1/2 inch and held in position by adhesive tape, small bolts or self-tapping screws.  A disc of 1/4 inch mesh screen is wired inside the wire cylinder about 1 1/2 inches above the top of the tin to form a floor for the bait cage, and a piece of plywood or galvanized metal is hooked on top of the wire cylinder to form a roof.  A piece of 16 gauge galvanized wire is placed underneath the middle of the tin that forms the bottom of the bait cage, and is bent to form two U-shaped slots to accommodate the rim of the tin.  Two such pieces of wire are then placed at right angles to each other across the spreader ring, this being a 12 inch diameter circle of stiff wire, which supports the cage within the trap.  Mice, or other small baits, are confined within the 2 inch high space between the roof and the wire mesh floor of the bait cage.\n\nDavies found that there was a greatly reduced catch if the trap bag was made of nylon mosquito netting with round holes. The most efficient traps had a bag of terylene netting with square holes and 22 meshes to the inch. It was also important that the floor of the wire mesh cylinder was made of finer mesh than its sides. If two or more adult mice are used the bait chamber should be divided to prevent fighting."

Traps consist of a 24 inch long section of 16 inch diameter galvanized ducting, fitted with collecting chambers at each end of the central tube.  The body of these chambers is constructed from a 6 inch length of 10 inch diameter galvanized tubing designed to fit over the crimped end of a 10 inch end cap.  The collecting chamber bodies are fitted to the inner faces of 16 inch diameter end plates using a crimped collar.  One collecting chamber slides over the crimped end of the main trap body, the other chamber is crimped to fit inside the main trap body.  Mosquitoes enter the collecting chambers through inward facing mesh funnels with a 1 inch diameter opening, and are prevented from feeding on the bait animal by a 16 mesh aluminum screen attached to the inside end of the collecting chambers.  Removal of mosquitoes from the collecting chambers is achieved as follows: the chambers are removed from the trap body and placed with the larger diameter end facing down onto an inflatable ring, as used by children to aid buoyancy when swimming, taped to a board.  A plastic shower-cap with a 1 cm hole is placed over the narrow end of the collecting chamber.  Mosquitoes can then be removed from the collecting chamber by removing the end cap and aspirating them." [ISBN:9781402066658]

They took a standard CDC trap and removed the light source and made the following modifications.  A semi-cylindrical cage (6 x 4 1/2 x 4 inches) made from 1/2 inch mesh wire screening wrapped round a plywood D-shaped base was attached by a metal hook to a 8 x 1/4 inch threaded metal rod fixed to one side of the CDC trap.  The hinged top of the bait cage was also made from wire screening.  A 1 1/2 inch thick layer of household sponge was placed on the floor of the bait cage to protect the bait from the cold, and also to facilitate cleaning the cage.  Traps operated from four 1.5 V torch batteries fixed to the CDC trap.  The collecting container consisted of a plastic 1-quart frozen food storage container with a section from the bottom and three sections from the side removed and replaced by plastic mosquito screening.  These screenings, and a cloth sleeve fixing the container to the trap, were embedded into the plastic with a soldering iron." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Trap for host-seeking adult arthropods, designed by Costantini, in which small animal odor is used as the primary attractant. \n\nCOMMENT:\nCostantini developed an odor-baited entry trap (OBET) that attempts to address some of the problems associated with landing catches, baited net traps and drop-nets.  The key feature of the trap is that the host odors are separated from other cues associated with the host, such as heat, visual cues, etc.  The OBET consists of a steel wire frame 40 cm high x 40 cm wide x 60 cm long, which is covered with mosquito netting.  A 50 cm long, 10 cm diameter plastic tube is inserted through the center of the rear panel of the cage and protrudes about 10 cm into the cage.  The tube is supported by two 10 cm diameter plastic rings and the end of the tube which is inside the cage is covered with mosquito netting to prevent mosquitoes entering it.  The rear end of the tube is attached to a length of polythene tubing, through which the host odors are delivered into the cage.  Inserted into the face of the cage opposite the plastic tube is a foam rubber hollow cylinder with an external diameter of 20 cm and walls 1 cm thick.  This foam rubber cylinder protrudes about 14 cm into the cage and is supported by 2 plastic rings.  Approximately 1 cm further into the cage another plastic ring (16 cm diameter) supporting a disc of mosquito netting is inserted.  This leaves a gap of approximately 1 cm between the internal end of the entry tube and the mosquito netting disc, through which the mosquitoes enter the trap.  Costantini introduced host odors to the trap from a tent containing bait animals.  The tent was constructed from heavy-duty polythene sheeting suspended from poles.  The dimensions of the tent can be adjusted to suit the size of the bait animals being used. A 10 cm diameter hole was cut into one face of the tent and a 12 V fan powered by a rechargeable battery was inserted and connected to the polythene tube, which was in turn connected to the plastic cylinder inserted into the rear of the trap.  The air stream produced by the fan is sufficient to fully inflate the polythene tube over a length of at least 12 m." [ISBN:9781402066658]

After removing the bulb a pigeon was placed in a 23 cm tall, 18 cm diameter cylindrical mesh bait cage positioned over the motor supports.  Double screening of the bait cage prevented vectors from biting the bait.  A timer switched the suction trap in for 1 min and blew the catch into a cyanide jar, this was followed by a 4 min off period. Power came from a 12 V battery." [ISBN:1851667989]

The roof is made to slope downwards on either side of the central panel.  Panels 20 cm wide are sewn to the edges of the roof and the side panels and slant inwards to help retain the catch.  At the two ends of the central panel the nylon netting of the roof and the end panels is extended to form a cone of netting leading to a plastic cylindrical collecting tube.  A straight length of rope is run along under the center of the roof adjacent to the central panel, to emerge through the conical extensions.  The two plastic collecting tubes are fixed to this rope, which is slanted upwards and tied to a tree.  Each collecting tube is 22 x 10 cm with an inverted funnel at the entrance.  The opposite end of the tube is removable and contains a small container with a perforated removable lid.  A killing agent is placed in the small tube.  Two thinner pieces of rope support the two outer edges of the roof panel, and are tied to a tree or staked to the ground some distance from the trap.  Rope is used to tie down the four bottom corners of the side panels and the two corners of the median panel.  Finally, a 30-cm high double strip of heavy black cotton poplin is sewn on to the lower edge of the median panel to help weight it down." [ISBN:9781402066658]

For greater strength it is advisable, though not essential, to sew a 10-inch square piece of cloth into the middle of the roof panel before a hole is cut out from it and a metal cylinder (coffee tin with both ends removed), is inserted.  A transparent plastic bag is tied by an elastic band to the top end of the cylinder.  A killing agent can be placed at the bottom of the plastic bag.  Two light pieces of wood (dowels, bamboo canes, etc.) are inserted across the inside of the two short sides of the roof panel to hold the net open.  A long loop of nylon cord is attached to each of the projecting ends of the wooden supports.  A piece of wire or string is passed under each nylon loop and attached in the middle to the top of the cylinder and its end secured to a tree.  This arrangement results in pulling the center of the roof panel upwards about 18 inches so that a funnel-shaped roof is formed that leads to the collecting bag." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The two compartments of the box are filled to a depth of about 12 cm with 4-6% formalin containing a few drops of detergent; in winter ethylene glycol can be added to prevent freezing.  One or two holes drilled in one side of the box at 12 cm and covered with fine netting prevent the trap overflowing after heavy rain.  Traps are mounted on aluminium poles.

def: "Ramp trap to collect adult arthropods in general flight designed by Gillies.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe trap is used at, or just above, ground level.  It is composed of two separate parts, a ramp unit and a detachable collecting cage.  The ramp consists of a wooden frame 6 ft long and 3 ft wide, covered with plastic or glass fiber netting and fixed by upright supports at an angle of 135 degrees.  Two triangular sections make up the ramp frame.  Initially each side section has the two equal sides 4 ft 6 inches long, but the upper inner corners are cut off to leave an upper side about 4 ft 2 inches long.  These two sections are mounted on either side of the ramp platform and a 4 ft 2 inches long, 3 ft wide roof rests horizontally across them.  When these side frames are fitted together, a 4 inch gap, through which mosquitoes pass into the collecting cage, is left between the top edge of the ramp and the inner edge of the roof. The framework of the entire ramp unit is covered with netting.  The collecting cage, which is 3 ft 5 inches wide, 1 ft 5 inches deep and 2 ft high, fits tightly against the vertical supports of the ramp.  A horizontal strut fixed some 7 inches from the top of the cage enables it to rest across the roof of the ramp.  The section of the front wall that fits over the ramp is covered with wood, while the rest of the cage is covered with netting.  There is nothing critical about the dimensions of the trap; all that is required is a suitably inclined ramp that will guide mosquitoes into a collecting cage." [ISBN:9781402066658]

name: ramp trap of Gillies and Wilkes
def: "Ramp trap to collect adult arthropods in general flight designed by Gillies and Wilkes.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe most important change in design from the ramp trap of Gillies is the separation of the ramp from the collecting cage.  This cage is 2 ft high, 3 ft wide, 1 ft 6 in deep and covered with plastic netting and is mounted on a 4 ft high stand.  A 3 inch entry slit with a hinged wooden lid is made in the cage.  The ramp unit consists of a sloping rectangular frame covered with wide-mesh nylon netting which is hooked on to the top of the cage stand.  Its bottom edge rests on the ground 6 ft in front of the stand supporting the collecting cage.  The tops of two 6-ft high vertical stakes inserted into the ground on either side of the bottom edge of the ramp are connected to the cage by horizontal bamboo canes.  The funnel-shaped framework that results from this construction is covered with wide-mesh, double weave cotton netting.  This netting was chosen in preference to ordinary mosquito netting as it presents less wind resistance.  The funnel entrance to the trap is about 6 ft high and a little less than 6 ft wide.  In general these traps caught larger numbers of mosquitoes than the older type, presumably due, at least in part, to the larger cross-sectional area of the ramp entrance." [ISBN:9781402066658]

It was fixed in front of a vehicle to avoid turbulence caused by air passing over the front end of the car.  The frame and supporting upright mounts fixing the trap to the front bumper are made of lightweight metal tubing about 1.9 cm in diameter.  The forward and rearward sections of the trap are of light canvas.  The 256 cm long middle section is made of fine mosquito netting with an entrance of 195 x 85 cm tapering to a 10 cm diameter opening at the rear which is connected to a removable 30 cm long netting bag.  The longest section of the trap is 112 cm, and all parts are easily packed into a fabric carrying case." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The trap is suspended from the luggage carrier of a bicycle and positioned adjacent to the rear wheel about 15-20 cm from the ground.  Mosquitoes collected in the trap could not be forced into a collecting bag at its rear, consequently the catch was removed at the end of each run with a battery operated aspirator.  Two modifications were suggested, namely that if the trap was mounted on the front wheel then a larger one could be used and there would be less turbulence around the mouth of the trap; secondly, if the trap was mounted on a small motorcycle it would be easier to handle and maintain at a constant speed."

Red-colored sticky cardboard, with a 310 x 15.5 mm area of proprietary adhesive on 1 side, was inserted into the tube, with the adhesive facing inwards.  One end of the trap was covered with gauze and two tubes were attached to the underside of a manhole cover.  One trap was positioned with the open end facing downwards and with the gauze-covered end against the underside of the manhole cover, covering the keyhole.  This acted as the exit trap.  The second pipe trap was positioned with the open end against the underside of the manhole cover and the gauze-covered end facing downwards.  This trap collected mosquitoes entering the sewer system through the keyholes in the manhole cover." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Trap for adult arthropods in general flight, in which suction action is used to capture arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nInsect suction traps measure the aerial density of insects at the site of the trap.  Because they do not employ any attractant the differences between numbers of various insects caught should reflect their natural densities.  Bidlingmayer and his colleagues have conducted several field experiments showing that their rather large L-shaped suction traps are visible to mosquitoes, as are surrounding bushes and trees.  They concluded that trap catches are influenced by these visible cues.  In addition to measuring absolute aerial densities suction traps can be used to study vertical distribution, diel flight activities, seasonal incidence, and flight direction.  Because they are non-attractant, visual cues excepted, few mosquitoes will be caught in the traps when populations are low, consequently prolonged sampling may be necessary if statistically reliable numbers are to be obtained.\n\nTwo very different designs of suction traps have been mainly used to sample mosquitoes: (1) vertical models employing a 22.9 cm Vent- Axia fan and (2 much larger L-shaped traps in which the 24 in fan is mounted on its side."

It is important that an impeller-type fan is used, i.e. a fan with reversed blades, so that the air is sucked down into the trap and not blown out.  The unit is mounted with the fan blades uppermost and the motor underneath.  Attached to the bottom of the fan is a copper, or monel metal, 21 inches long cone made of 26 mesh gauze.  Three equally spaced metal struts run down the outside of the cone and extend beyond it to hold in position the metal cylindrical casing that houses the collecting magazine.  A central 24 inches long rust proof metal guide rod is bolted to the base of the motor casing and projects downwards through the mesh cone to extend about an inch beyond the bottom of the collecting magazine.  A solenoid and disc release mechanism is mounted just beneath the motor.  Each segregating disc is made of brass or stainless steel, is 1 1/4 inches in diameter and has a central collar 1/4 inch high and 5/16 inches in diameter to keep the discs apart.  When a disc is released and falls down magazine ensuring that small insects are not missed but trapped between the central guide rod this fringe brushes against the walls of the collecting magazine ensuring that small insects are not missed but trapped between successive discs.  The discs should be soaked in 1-3% pyrethrum solution or other killing agent.  Insects are drawn into the trap by the fan and are gently blown down the collecting cone and deposited on to an oil film smeared on the upper exposed surface of the last fallen disc.  They are killed by the killing agent and are sealed off by the next disc that descends the rod.  The traps are operated from mains electricity and a control box allows the fans to work at slow, normal or boost speeds. Unless mosquito densities are high, traps are best operated on the fastest speed as this samples a greater volume of air.  An electromagnetically operated time switch allows the discs to be released at pre-set time intervals." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Exposed suction trap for adult arthropods in general flight that includes a Vent-Axia fan.\n\nCOMMENT:\nWhen it is not necessary to divide the catch of mosquitoes into time intervals a much simpler suction trap than the Johnson and Taylor one, without any segregating mechanisms, can be used and the catch removed daily or at longer intervals.  A simple but efficient suction trap can be constructed from a 6, 7.5, 9 or 12 inches Vent-Axia fan made for window mounting, at boost speeds these fans sample 12 000, 18 000, 30 000 and 62 000 cubic ft of air per h.  First, the outer grill is removed, then any recesses or ledges near the fan blades are covered over and the fan unit inserted into a circular hole cut out from a piece of plywood.  A monel gauze collecting cone is attached to the board underneath the fan and a small fine mesh bag is tied to the bottom of the cone to collect the mosquitoes.  Two 1 inch holes are drilled at opposite ends of the board and lengths of 5/8 inch galvanized tubing inserted and pushed into the ground.  By securing the board to the tubing by small adjustable clamps its height can be easily altered, thus allowing the trap to be used at various heights.  Wire from the trap enters a control box, which allows the use of three fan speeds.  Control boxes from a number of fans can be mounted within a waterproof metal box.  A length of flexible tubing, having a diameter several inches larger than the base of the collecting cone, can be attached underneath the plywood board to enclose the cone and thus reduce the effect of cross-winds on sampling efficiency.  However, if the trap is used in sheltered positions, such as near the ground or amongst the shelter of vegetation this may not be necessary.  Trap inlets must be positioned near the ground to sample mosquitoes flying near the ground. In very dry areas this can be achieved by just digging a hole and lowering the trap into it, in which case care must be taken that the filtered air exhausted from the trap is conducted away from the fan inlet and not re-sampled, thereby reducing the sample volume."

He constructed a group of four suction traps into a single unit.  Each trap consisted of an 8 inch fan mounted at the top of a 10 inch diameter, 18 inch long cylinder, which had a copper mesh (14 x 18 meshes/inch) collecting cone at the base leading to a small collecting cage.  A jointed and elbowed 10 inch diameter metal cylinder, with a flared opening 13 1/2 inches in diameter at right angles to the fan, was mounted on top of the trap.  The openings of the four traps comprising a single unit faced different directions. Horsfall considered that when an 8 inch diameter fan was used insects were drawn into the traps from a distance of up to 6 inches from the openings.  However, this obviously will depend, among other factors, on wind speed and insect size.  Because of the limited distance from which mosquitoes were sucked into the traps Horsfall considered that those collected were mainly individuals flying towards the traps and consequently directional flight was measured.  Trap construction could be simplified by using flexible tubing instead of a jointed metal cylinder; alternatively the traps could be positioned on their sides with their openings perpendicular to the ground."

The fan consists of an Air-max type PR-Y4393 in an aluminum casing, 15.2 cm in internal diameter and 12 cm deep.  The fan blades are inverted and the wires to the motor brushes switched to reverse the direction of rotation.  A flared inlet made from a 5 cm strip cut from the top of a plastic funnel is fitted to the top of the fan housing.  A 6 cm deep flange bolted to the bottom of the fan casing holds in position a nylon mesh cone tapering to a mesh collecting bag.  The trap weighs about 1.6 kg.  The fan has a 31 W motor and operates at 2900 rev/min from two 25-Amphr alkaline batteries connected in parallel, the combined weight of which is about 37 kg.  The batteries run the trap for about 16 h. The volume of air sampled is in the 330-350 cubic m/h range." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Suction trap for adult arthropods in general flight designed by Barnard and Mulla.\n\nCOMMENT:\nBarnard and Mulla constructed an inexpensive and simple suction trap.  It consists of a 36 inches long and 21 inch diameter galvanized metal cylinder supported on three 1/2 inch angle-iron legs, adjusted to position the top of the cylinder 54 inches from the ground.  A 20 inch, 5 bladed fan attached to a 115 V, 2.6 A motor (McGraw-Edison model 7327) is mounted on a metal plate supported by three 1 inch wide metal arms in the lower part of the cylinder.  The motor sucks air through the trap at the rate of 2600 cubic ft/min.  A nylon netting cone is pulled over a metal band that is placed over the top of the trap, and a plastic vial with a mesh screen bottom is fixed with an elastic band on to the bottom of the cone.  This is removed at the end of each sampling period." [ISBN:9781402066658]

name: Wilton and Kloter cylinder trap
def: "Powered trap, designated the Wilton and Kloter cylinder trap, which combines a visual color attractant and short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nWilton and Kloter devised a trap for sampling Aedes aegypti which is lighter, more compact and more easily made than the Fay-Prince trap.  It consists of an 18-cm length of plexiglas having an outside diameter of 9.5 cm and painted shiny black on the inside.  It is fitted with machine bolts to the bottom of the plastic body of a CDC light-trap which has had the bottom part cut off to leave a 1-cm extension below the reinforced ring.  The light-bulb is removed, and the trap inverted so that the CDC part is positioned below.  A 1-pint paper carton painted black on the inside and outside and with the bottom replaced with black netting is dropped into the top of the trap.  A screen cone is fitted into the top of the carton to prevent mosquitoes escaping if there is a power failure.  The trap operates from a 6-V battery." [ISBN:9781402066658]

def: "Powered trap, designated the duplex cone trap, which combines a visual color attractant with short-range suction action to collect host-seeking adult arthropods.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe invasion of the USA by Aedes albopictus challenged American entomologists to devise a trap that could be used for surveillance of adults of this species.  Carbon dioxide and light-traps have proved ineffective in Southeast Asia for collecting Aedes albopictus, but it was noted in Louisiana, USA that adults often settled on shiny black plastic bags, and this eventually led Freier and Francy to develop a duplex cone trap.  The components of the trap are a 48-cm diameter, 41-cm tall black cone that has thirty 2.5-cm holes cut from around the base.  This black cone is surmounted with a 50-cm diameter, 34-cm tall shiny galvanized cone supported 20 cm from the ground by four metal legs.  A 10-cm diameter collar connects the top of the outer cone to a 46.5-cm tall, 8.3-cm diameter plastic cylinder which houses a CDC-type motor and fan powered by a 6-V battery.  The trap is positioned over about 1 kg dry ice placed on the ground.  Gas escapes through the holes around the base of the black cone and mosquitoes attracted by odor and the black cone are sucked up by the fan between the two cones into a CDC-type collecting bag placed on top of the trap."

The trap itself is a suction trap constructed from a 10-cm length of thin walled PVC pipe, a 6V d.c. motor and fan mounted onto a piece of sheet metal, and a PVC pipe collection container.  This suction trap is mounted on a modified battery-powered baby swing, which provides the back-and-forth motion.  The swing was modified by removing the seat and replacing it with four panels of 4-mm thick black polyethylene plastic sheeting, to form a box open at the top and bottom.  The rear panel of this box measured 64 cm long × 23 cm wide and was attached to the top part of the swinging frame.  The front panel was 36 cm long × 25 cm wide and the two side panels were 36 cm long × 30 cm wide." [ISBN:9781402066658]

The diameter is 36 cm (14 inches), the height 40 cm (1.3 feet).  In the middle of the gauze cover, air is sucked into the trap through a black catch pipe by an electrical fan, drawing approaching mosquitoes into a catch bag.  The air then exits the trap through the white gauze, generating ascending currents.   These are similar to convection currents produced by a human host, both in its direction, its geometrical structure, and, due to the addition of the BG-Lure, also in its chemical composition.\n\nThis trap was initially developed to catch Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus,  With the addition of carbon dioxide, the BG-Sentinel can be used as a surveillance tool for mosquitoes in general."

comment: Note that adjacent_to as thus defined is not a symmetric relation, in contrast to its instance-level counterpart.

comment: Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):

def: "Derivation on the instance level (*derives_from*) holds between distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later. We say that one class C derives_from class C' if instances of C are connected to instances of C' via some chain of instance-level derivation relations. Example: osteocyte derives_from osteoblast. Formally: C derives_immediately_from C' if and only if: given any c and any t, if c instantiates C at time t, then there is some c' and some t', such that c' instantiates C' at t' and t' earlier-than t and c *derives_from* c'. C derives_from C' if and only if: there is an chain of immediate derivation relations connecting C to C'." [PMID:15892874]
comment: Derivation as a relation between instances. The temporal relation of derivation is more complex. Transformation, on the instance level, is just the relation of identity: each adult is identical to some child existing at some earlier time. Derivation on the instance-level is a relation holding between non-identicals. More precisely, it holds between distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later. Thus we will have axioms to the effect that from c derives_from c1 we can infer that c and c1 are not identical and that there is some instant of time t such that c1 exists only prior to and c only subsequent to t. We will also be able to infer that the spatial region occupied by c as it begins to exist at t overlaps with the spatial region occupied by c1 as it ceases to exist in the same instant.

comment: OBSOLETE. The definition is "As for part_of, with the additional constraint that subject and object may be identical". However, part_of is already reflexive, therefore improper_part_of is identical to part_of. If read differently, as "improper_part_of is part_of but not proper_part_of",improper_part_of becomes identity. So, improper_part_of is either identical to part_of or to identity, and not an intuitive synonym for either of them. [Robert Hoehndorf]

comment: Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus

comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.

def: "P preceded_by P' if and only if: given any process p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some process p' such that p' instantiates P' at time t', and t' is earlier than t. " [PMID:15892874]
comment: An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.

comment: When an embryonic oenocyte (a type of insect cell) is transformed into a larval oenocyte, one and the same continuant entity preserves its identity while instantiating distinct classes at distinct times. The class-level relation transformation_of obtains between continuant classes C and C1 wherever each instance of the class C is such as to have existed at some earlier time as an instance of the distinct class C1 (see Figure 2 in paper). This relation is illustrated first of all at the molecular level of granularity by the relation between mature RNA and the pre-RNA from which it is processed, or between (UV-induced) thymine-dimer and thymine dinucleotide. At coarser levels of granularity it is illustrated by the transformations involved in the creation of red blood cells, for example, from reticulocyte to erythrocyte, and by processes of development, for example, from larva to pupa, or from (post-gastrular) embryo to fetus or from child to adult. It is also manifest in pathological transformations, for example, of normal colon into carcinomatous colon. In each such case, one and the same continuant entity instantiates distinct classes at different times in virtue of phenotypic changes.
